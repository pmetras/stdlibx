## Working Style

**Complete the plan, then check in**: When a plan is approved, execute all steps to completion. Don't stop after each step for review. When you think you're done, recursively apply all relevant principles from this file — check each one, act on any that apply, then check again until no more principles are relevant. Only then report completion and wait for feedback.

**Plans require discussion before implementation**: After devising a plan (whether in plan mode or not), run the review loop (see "Mandatory review checkpoints") before presenting it. Do NOT proceed to implementation until
the plan has been seen and explicitly approved.

**Mandatory review checkpoints**: At each of these points, run the full review loop — spawn a fresh-context reviewer subagent, address findings, spawn another fresh reviewer, repeat until a reviewer finds no issues. When you disagree with a reviewer's finding, escalate — do not resolve disputes unilaterally. Do not proceed past a checkpoint without a clean review.
1. **After devising a plan**, before presenting it for discussion. For plan reviews, adapt the reviewer prompt: instead of reading changed files and running tests, the reviewer should read the plan document, read existing code the plan references, verify assumptions about the codebase, and check for structural gaps (missing steps, naming conflicts, incorrect dependencies).
2. **After completing implementation and self-review**, before opening a PR.

The only exception: if you believe a change is truly trivial (a typo fix, a one-line config change), ask for permission to skip the review. Do not decide on your own that something is trivial enough to skip. When in doubt, run the review.

**Discuss important decisions before acting**: When encountering an important decision point — architectural choices, tradeoffs between approaches, anything that could meaningfully change the direction of work — stop and discuss first. Don't pick a path silently.

**Apply principles before escalating decisions**: Before presenting a design decision as an open question, check whether existing principles already resolve it. If a principle clearly answers the question, apply it and state which principle you used. Only escalate decisions that the principles don't cover or where multiple principles conflict.

**Challenge me when the evidence says I'm wrong**: I use Claude or Gemini reviews because I can be wrong. If a reviewer flags something that contradicts what I said, or if Claude or Gemini has concrete evidence that my instruction is incorrect, raise it — don't silently comply. The whole point of the review process is catching mistakes from everyone, me included. Present the evidence and discuss it. This isn't pushback; it's the collaboration working as intended.

**Cross-project lessons go here**: When we discover insights, patterns, or techniques that are useful across projects (not just the current one), write them to this file, not to project-specific memory files where they'll get lost.

**Ask about project conventions**: Always ask whether we want to preserve the existing coding patterns, unless the answer is already recorded (e.g., in a project CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md). The answer may be: preserve them because we like them, preserve them for consistency even if we don't prefer them, or intentionally deviate from them. Don't assume — the choice depends on context.

**Go slow to go fast**: Before starting implementation work, identify and state which principles from these instructions are most relevant to the current task. This surfaces the right guidelines before they're needed rather than rediscovering them after a mistake.

**Research findings belong in the plan**: If research or exploration surfaces issues beyond the original task (inaccurate comments, dead code, related bugs), include them as explicit plan steps — don't just mention them in the analysis and move on. Anything worth noting is worth acting on or explicitly deferring. For findings outside the current branch's scope, add them to a TODO list to track them.

**Report bugs in dependencies; do not work around them**: When a bug is discovered in a dependency or external package, stop and report it to the user with a clear diagnosis and a suggested fix. Do not silently work around the bug in consuming code — workarounds hide the root cause, accumulate as technical debt, and prevent the dependency from being fixed. The consuming code should reflect correct usage, not defensive coding against broken dependencies.

**Self-review is part of "done"**: The recursive principle check described in "Complete the plan, then check in" IS the self-review. It's not a separate step — it's what "done" means. Never report completion without having done it.

**During reviewer loops**: At any point during the review loop — when fixing findings, when unsure about a reviewer's suggestion, when making tradeoff decisions — stop and ask. The automated review removes me as a gatekeeper, not as a collaborator. After a clean review at the pre-PR checkpoint, stop to report "ready for PR" and wait for permission.

**Questions aren't corrections**: When I ask about code, don't assume I'm flagging a problem. I often ask to confirm my understanding or verify intent. Respond with a clear, direct confirmation rather than a defensive explanation. I'll say explicitly if something is wrong.

**Principle review**: A structured code review that combines general correctness checking with systematic evaluation against the principles in this file.

Automated mode — the writer session spawns a reviewer subagent:
1. The reviewer must start with fresh context — do not use an agent type that inherits the writer's conversation history.
2. The prompt must include:
   - Instructions to read CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md, including AGENTS.md for principles and project context.
   - The sources to review (branch name, base branch, design doc location).
   - Instructions to read all changed files in full (not just the diff), plus supporting files needed for verification.
   - Instructions to build and run tests.
   - Deliver the two-part review (general correctness + principle-by-principle).
   - Context from prior reviews, if any: settled decisions, opened issues, or fixes already in progress.
3. Factual accuracy requirement: The prompt must instruct the reviewer to verify every factual claim by reading the actual code. Do not summarize from memory or inference.
4. Dispute resolution: Fix agreed-upon findings independently; only escalate items where you disagree with the reviewer. Present the dispute to me. I rule. Pass the ruling to the next reviewer as prior-review context.

## Code Design Principles

1. **Prefer explicit over implicit**: When the language or framework allows something to work "by magic" (implicit conversions, convention-based wiring, unnamed dependencies), prefer the version that states what's happening directly. The cost of a few extra characters or lines is almost always less than the cost of someone later needing to reconstruct the hidden knowledge. Several principles below are specific applications of this idea.

2. **Make illegal states unrepresentable**: Centralize validation at the construction boundary so the rest of the code can trust its inputs. In strongly typed languages (F#, Rust, Haskell), lean on the compiler with private constructors and factory methods that return error-or-value. In dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, JS), enforce this by convention with validated types that are trustworthy once constructed. The strictness is a gradient depending on your language's type system, but the principle — validate once at creation, trust everywhere after — is universal.

3. **Errors are data, not exceptions**: Each layer should define its own error vocabulary as a concrete type (enum, union, sealed class). Higher-level errors wrap lower-level ones to preserve full context. Every error type should know how to describe itself as text. This gives exhaustive handling, no information loss during propagation, and clear error provenance.

4. **Separate data shape from data validity**: For complex types, define a "raw" structure for the data shape and a validated wrapper that guarantees correctness. Construction goes: raw shape -> validation -> validated wrapper. The rest of the system works with the validated form.

5. **Define separate types for each data boundary** (applications): In applications with multiple boundaries, user input, database records, and API responses should be distinct types even when they represent the same concept. A database record has an auto-generated ID; user input doesn't. Making these distinct prevents mixing concerns.

6. **Default to immutability; use mutation deliberately and locally**: When performance demands mutation, confine it to the smallest possible scope. The rest of the system shouldn't know or care.

7. **Prefer qualified/namespaced references**: Even when the language lets you import names unqualified, prefer namespaced references (e.g., Module.foo over foo). The cost of a few extra characters is outweighed by the clarity of knowing where something comes from and avoiding name collisions as the code grows.

8. **Ask about sensitive data**: When handling data, ask if any of it is sensitive and if yes, how it should be handled. The answer may be redaction, encryption, masking, or something else depending on context.

9. **Separate domain logic from orchestration from presentation** (applications): In applications with distinct layers, domain types should have zero infrastructure dependencies. Orchestration combines domain logic with infrastructure (databases, caches). Presentation adapts orchestration for a specific protocol (HTTP, GraphQL, CLI).

10. **Design for changeability, not for predicted changes**: Make designs modular and replaceable so future needs can be accommodated, but don't add abstractions, extension points, or features for changes that haven't happened yet. The goal is a design that's easy to modify, not one that anticipates specific modifications.

11. **Document coupling at the point of breakage**: When code A depends on the internal behavior of code B (read sequence, execution order, size assumptions), put the comment on B — that's where a future maintainer would make a breaking change. Commenting at A ("we depend on B") doesn't help because the person changing B won't be reading A.

12. **Distinct semantics deserve distinct representations**: When two values have different meanings or different handling semantics, represent them as separate types even when one could technically serve for both. Overloading a single type to carry multiple meanings forces callers to use out-of-band knowledge to distinguish them.

13. **It is easier to give than take away**: When deciding whether to include something in an API (a callback, a parameter, a feature), lean toward omitting it. You can always add it later if needed, but removing it is a breaking change. Start minimal; expand based on demonstrated need.

**Present evidence before executing corrections**: When told to undo or change something, and you have concrete evidence for why it was done that way (not just opinion), share the evidence before acting. The user may not have the same context you do. This isn't pushback — it's making sure decisions are informed. Execute the change after sharing, unless the user reconsiders.

## Code Change Discipline

**Read before modifying**: Do not propose changes to code you haven't read. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.

**Prefer editing over creating**: Edit existing files rather than creating new ones. This prevents file bloat and builds on existing work.

**Avoid over-engineering**: Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary.
- Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen.
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change.
- Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations.
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.

**Evaluate copied patterns, don't cargo-cult them**: When reusing a pattern from existing code, evaluate each choice (var vs let, error handling style, data structure, etc.) in the context of the new usage. The original may have had reasons that don't apply, or it may have been a mistake in the original. Copy the intent, not the incidental choices.
- Pre-action check: Before reusing a pattern from existing code, ask: "Does the new usage actually need each piece of this?" Strip it down to what's required first, then add back only what's justified. The default should be the simplest version, not a copy of the most similar existing code.
- Distinguish conventions from technical patterns: Conventions (legal headers, naming schemes, file organization) exist for consistency or organizational reasons — follow them. Technical approach patterns (error handling style, test methodology, data structures) should be evaluated on merit for the new context. When in doubt about which category something falls into, the presence of the pattern across all files in the repo suggests convention.

**No backwards-compatibility hacks**: Don't rename unused variables to _var, re-export removed types, or add "// removed" comments. If something is unused, delete it.

**Fix what your change makes stale**: When a change invalidates something elsewhere — a comment, a docstring, a test description, documentation, a configuration reference — fix it in the same PR. Stale artifacts left behind are bugs in the making, and "I didn't modify that line" isn't an excuse when your change is what made it wrong.

## Testing

### Test Style Preference

**Favor property-based tests (or generative variants) over example-based unit tests.** Property-based tests define invariants that hold for all inputs and use generated data to find counterexamples. Generative tests use the same generator machinery but in a more example-based style — e.g., a "valid inputs" generator exercising code to confirm all are accepted, and an "invalid inputs" generator confirming all are rejected.

### Property-Based & Generative Testing Patterns

1. **The Valid/Invalid/Mixed generator triad**: For any validated type or input boundary, create three coordinated generators: one that only produces valid inputs, one that only produces invalid inputs, and a mixed generator that wraps both. This yields three properties: "good data always succeeds," "bad data always fails," and "mixed data succeeds if and only if it's the valid variant." The mixed property is the strongest — it asserts the exact boundary between acceptance and rejection.

2. **Invalid generators should cover every failure mode**: Invalid input generators should use the equivalent of oneof across distinct failure modes (too short, too long, invalid characters, reserved words, etc.) rather than just generating random bad data. This exercises all rejection branches, not just the easiest-to-hit path.

3. **Derive generators from validation rules**: Build generators mechanically from the same constants and rules the validators use (min/max length, allowed character sets, regexes, etc.). Valid generators produce inputs matching the rules; invalid generators negate them. This eliminates drift between what the validator checks and what the generator produces.

4. **Compositional generator hierarchy**: Compose complex generators from simpler validated ones. A generator for a composite type should be built from generators for its constituent parts. Each level reuses the generators from below, so complex valid inputs are always internally consistent. This is the property-based testing equivalent of builder patterns.

5. **Test from multiple angles**: Look for ways to verify the same behavior from more than one direction. This could mean comparing two independent implementations, checking a result against a derived invariant, or roundtripping through encode/decode. Testing from multiple angles catches bugs in both the implementation and the test logic itself.

6. **Balance edge-case coverage against iteration speed**: When generating test data, bias toward smaller/simpler inputs for fast feedback while still exercising expensive edge cases (max-size inputs, boundary conditions) at a lower frequency. The goal is a healthy mix — most runs iterate quickly, but unlikely/extreme scenarios still get covered regularly rather than never.

7. **Supplement property tests with examples for unreachable paths**: When code dispatches across multiple paths based on value size (format families, encoding tiers, protocol variants), constrained property generators will only cover some paths. A generator producing strings 0–100 chars exercises fixstr and str_8 but never str_16. The property test is still valuable for the boundary it tests (accept/reject at the limit), but it silently leaves entire code paths uncovered. Add targeted example-based tests for the dispatch paths generators can't efficiently reach.

### Counterfactual Testing ("Make It Fail, Make It Pass")

**Always do this** after writing new tests unless you truly can't find a way to break the assertion and are very confident the test is correct. A test you've never seen fail is a test you don't trust. Temporarily break each assertion to confirm it actually fires:
1. Make a targeted change that should cause exactly one assertion to fail
2. Run tests, confirm the expected failure message
3. Revert the change

**Key takeaway**: When a counterfactual passes (assertion doesn't fire), that's the most valuable outcome — it means the assertion is weak/wrong. Treat counterfactual testing as a bug-finding technique, not just a confidence ritual.

**Workflow rule**: After writing a new test and seeing it pass, do NOT report success yet. First, do a counterfactual check. Only report the test results after the counterfactual confirms the assertions are meaningful.

### Debugging Discipline

**"How do you know that you know that?"**: When debugging, a hypothesis about the cause is not knowledge — it's a guess. Never act on an unverified hypothesis. Before investing effort in workarounds or fixes, validate empirically that your suspected cause is actually the cause. Sometimes that's a minimal test that isolates one variable; sometimes it's examining the actual data instead of assuming what it contains; sometimes it's reading the code more carefully. The method varies, but the discipline doesn't: verify first, then act.

**Probe external data shapes empirically**: When consuming external data sources (APIs, files, databases), verify the actual data shape with a real probe — don't trust documentation or reasoning alone. A single API call, database query, or file inspection is worth more than any amount of documentation reading or inference.

**CI is the source of truth for build status**: A local build failure does not mean the build is broken. Local toolchain versions, stale dependency caches, and environment differences can all cause local failures that don't reproduce in CI. Never declare a build "broken on main" based on local results — check CI first.
